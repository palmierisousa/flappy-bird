# Flappy Bird
This project is a simple version of Flappy Bird game and was developed using HTML, Javascript and CSS. The main objective of this project was training the basics concepts about that technologies. Therefore, I didn't use technologies like Canvas or any API specific for games in browser.

The game runs entirely in the client-side, all is performed in the browser.

## Game Structure
The game engine was implemented on [flappy.js](js/flappy.js) file.

The scenario, bird and tubes were designed on [flappy.css](css/flappy.css) file.


## Install
Download the project and open the [flappy.html](flappy.html) file on your prefered browser.

## Controls
As soon as you load the [flappy.html](flappy.html) file, the game begins. To control the bird, you can use any key on the keyboard. The bird flies up more quickly than it goes down.

## Objective
The objective is to pass with the bird between the big green tubes without touching them. Every time the bird passes between the tubes, one point is scored.

The game is infinite, so play forever and ever!!!
